# Machine-Learning-Assignments
The following codes are the assignments covered in our machine learning course.

For this we worked in a group of 3 

The scores we achieved for the assignmnets are as follows:

1] Assignment 1 - 100/100

2] Assignment 2 - 120/100

3] Assignment 3 - 117/100


**Project Description**:-

1] **Classification and Regression** :- 

  Two data sets. are provided :
    a] 2-D data set in sample.pickle 
    b] Medical data set in diabetes.pickle  
  Our task is to make final recommendation for anyone using the model fro predicting diabetes level using the input features.
 
2] **Hand Written Digits classification**:-

  Data sets used:-
    a] mnist_all.mat
    b] face_all.pickle 
  Our task was to implement Neural Network (forward and back propogation) incorporating regularization on the weights to predict the hand written digits.
  Write a deep neural code and compare the results with normal neural network on the celeA data set
  Also had to write a convolution neural network code and print the confusion matrix. 

3] SVM and Logistic Regression:-

  * Implement Logistic Regression and give the prediction results
  * Use SVm to perform the classification
  * for extra credit: Implement the gradient descent minimization of multi-class Logistic Regression
